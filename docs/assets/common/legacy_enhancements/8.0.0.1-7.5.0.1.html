<h2>RING 8.0.0.1</h2>

<p>RING 8.0.0.1 introduced the following enhancements. </p>

<h3>Zimbra Connector Compatibility</h3>

<p>The Scality Zimbra connector 8.0.0.1 and above are exclusively compatible
with Zimbra 8.8.15 and above. Scality Zimbra connector versions below 8.0.0.1
are exclusively compatible with Zimbra versions below 8.8.15.</p>

<h2>S3 Connector 7.5.0.1</h2>

<h3>S3 Bucket Policies</h3>

<p>Scality supports Bucket Policies as part of the S3 API. By applying a bucket
policy to a bucket, a user grants other AWS accounts or IAM users access
permissions for the bucket and the objects within. For this API, Scality
specifically supports the creation of bucket policies with account ID, Account
ARN, User ARN and canonical ID.</p>
