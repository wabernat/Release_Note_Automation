<div class="textbox">Scality RING 8 consists of two distinct components, the RING and the S3 Connector.
Because these components are on separate development paths, each RING 8 release may embed version
increments of each that differ. The initial release of RING 8, for example, comprised RING v8.0.0.0 and
  S3 Connector v7.5.0.0.</div>
