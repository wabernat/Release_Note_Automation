<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>New for Version 1.1</h2>

With release 1.1 Zenko introduces the following features.

<h3>Transition Policies</h3>

<p>For Release 1.1, Zenko supports transition policies. With Transition
Policies, you can configure Zenko to transition (move) stored files
from a bucket in one backend (for example, a Scality RING) to a
supported public cloud, based on a calendar date or an object’s age
and object-tag metadata. Once Zenko has put data to the storage
destination bucket, it deletes it from the source bucket.</p>

<p>For example, if a user needs “live” data stored in a local RING (for
low latency), but wants to move older, less-active data to a
higher-latency public cloud for inexpensive long-term storage, the
user can set a transition policy to the following criteria: for the
“financial-department” bucket on the local RING, transition all
objects tagged with an “accounts_payable” prefix to the
“financial-department” bucket at Wasabi Cloud when such objects have a
date stamp of 45 days or more.</p>

<p>This feature is included by default in Zenko 1.1.</p>

<h3>Out-of-Band Updates</h3>

<p>Starting with version 1.1, Zenko can ingest the namespace metadata
from the Scality RING’s native Scale-Out File System (SOFS) over
NFS. If this feature is enabled, Zenko detects state changes in the
metadata describing objects in SOFS (on a schedule) and replicates
changed objects to other clouds as configured. This also enables Zenko
users to access advanced Zenko features (such as metadata search) that
require access to a managed system’s metadata.</p>

<h3>Single-Server Zenko</h3>

<p>Customers willing to sacrifice high availability for a simple,
economical Zenko deployment gain Scality support for single-server
Zenko deployments with Release 1.1. Obviously, a single-server
deployment presents a single point of failure. However, for those
willing to employ this topology, the upgrade path from single-server
Zenko to more robust multi-node (three, five, seven, or more servers)
is clear, well supported, and unproblematic.</p>
