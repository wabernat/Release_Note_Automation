# This file specifies the order components should be added to the generated document.
#
# -- So where do the file names come from? --
# To reference files from within the same product (denoted by asset/<product>) simply use the file name (eg introduction.html)
# To reference files from other projects, or from common, prefix it with the subdirectory name (eg common/issue_header.html)
# To reference templates use the special prefix `$templates/` along with the variant eg `$templates/issues.known for the known issues table
#
# NOTE: Isolating files by product is not enforced by notomaton, both for flexibility and simplicity. *You* are the only one
#       standing in the way of it turning into a giant pile of spaghetti. WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.
