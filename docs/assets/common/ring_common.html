<div class="textbox">RING 8 consists of two distinct components: the RING and
the S3 Connector.  Because these components are on separate development paths,
each RING 8 release may embed different version increments of each
component. The initial release of RING 8, for example, comprised RING v8.0.0.0
and S3 Connector v7.5.0.0.</div>
<h2>RING 8 Product Organization</h2>
