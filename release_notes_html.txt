1. Introduction (summary of enhancements)

   Current practice is to publish a cumulative list of releases (7.4.3
   introduces, 7.4.2 introduced...) as unheaded summary paragraphs. I
   hope we can dispense with this quaint custom. Our POC should do
   this, and if they argue we need to change it, we can either include
   previous versions as text or by queries. Managing the verion
   numbering will be a challenge.

2. Enhancements (detail)

   Current practice is a cumulative list of headed paragraphs. I would
   prefer non-cumulative.  For the time being, this should be
   narrative text. Eventually (when we are more diciplined in our Jira
   use), this could be a query of all epics with a "done" status for
   the current fixVersion.

3. {Product name} product documentation
   
   - Where to find documentation
   - Supported OSes
   - What the Severity labels mean
   
   These are all narrative. Where to find documentation may be
   susceptible to automation (i.e., documentation.scality.com/zenko/1.1/index.html
   where "zenko" and "1.1" are product/project and fixVersion variables.)
