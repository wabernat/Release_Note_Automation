<h2>RING 8.0.0.0/S3 Connector 7.5.0.0</h2>

<p>The 8.0.0.0 RING release introduced the following enhancements.</p>

<h3>Distributed Lock Manager</h3>

<p>The Distributed Lock Manager (DLM) is a lock service for processes
distributed across the network that enables the coordination of multiple SOFS
connectors over the same SOFS volume. With this new RING feature, particular
focus has been placed on:
<ul>
  <li>Improving infrastructure robustness to provide better recovery support</li>
  <li>Making it possible to deploy DLM-enabled connectors across multiple sites. </li>
  <li>Relying on a full userland implementation and removing kernel module dependencies.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>New NFS Connector</h3>
    <p>RING 8 offers a new NFS connector based on the open-source Ganesha file
      server. The connector supports:
      <ul>
	<li> NFSv4 protocol
	  <ul>
	    <li>Export management (NFSv4 pseudo-filesystem provides maximum
	      flexibility. Export pathname on servers can be changed
	      transparently to clients.)</li>
	    <li>Locking and State (in NFSv4, locking operations are part of the
	      protocol, and NFSv4 servers keep track of open files)</li>
            <li>Security (the NFSv4 protocol improves security over previous NFS
              versions)</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>IPV6 support from the connector side</p>
	  <p>Applications can now directly connect to a RING NFS connector using
	  IPv6. (The underlying RING nodes still run IPv4.)</p></li>
	<li><p>Kerberos authentication</p>
	  <p>The new NFS connector can be used with Kerberos to manage user
	  authentication and application access. Kerberos provides strong
	  cryptography and third-party ticket authorization.</p></li>
  <li><p>POSIX ACL</p>
    <p>POSIX ACL is now stored on files and directories, whereas another protocol
    is required to set POSIX ACL.<p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Non-Root Execution</h3>
<p>Starting with the RING 8 release, RING components run under a non-root
user. This change affects the following processes: biziod, bizstorenode,
bizstoresup, supv2, sagentd, scloned, sfused, sindexd, sproxyd, srebuildd,
dewpoint, scaldisk, sophiad, sflushd and RS2/bizstore. (SVSD still runs as root,
and S3 connector processes remain unchanged.)</p>

<p>Both new installation and upgrade are taken into account transparently.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Packaging scripts continue to ensure that the local “scality” user exists, to adapt the current
    solution to legacy RING platforms that lacked this user.</li>
  <li>Startup scripts typically ensure that the scality user exists.</li>
  </ul>
<p>File hierarchy changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scality configuration files that were previously stored in /etc are now
	present in /etc/scality. For detailed information, refer
	to <i><a href="https://documentation.scality.com/RING/8.0.0/operation/index.html">RING
	Operation</a></i>.</li>
    <li>Post-install scripts and startup scripts have been updated to take
        package changes into account.<!-- For an overview of specific package
        changes, refer to the package notes in the "Component Details" section
        of <i><a href="https://documentation.scality.com/RING/8.0.0/operation/index.html">RING
        Operation</a></i>.--></li>
    <li>Ownership:
      <ul>
        <li>The “scality” user now owns the /var/log/scality directory.</li>
        <li>The “scality” user now owns the /var/run/scality and /run/scality directories.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>Impact on production:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The root user can no longer manually stop processes; scripts are required to stop services.</li>
  <li>As the root user is no longer used for disk writes, verify that the reserved block count, as
    reported by <code>tun2fs -l {{device}}</code> is zero for all Scality partitions.</li>
  <li>Custom scripts must be updated to reflect the described configuration changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>KMIP for KMS</h3>

<p>Scality&#39;s support for the OASIS Key Management Interoperability Protocol
(KMIP) standard allows users to interact with their key management systems (KMS)
using the fully open standard protocol&mdash;in contrast to proprietary
alternatives. The KMIP protocol version 1.2 (and later) allows for streamlined
data encryption by simplifying encryption key management. The KMIP driver is
vendor agnostic and supports all KMIP appliances with Basic Encryption Profile
support out of the box.</p>

<h3>S3 Quotas</h3>

<p>The S3 Quotas feature allows users to administer account-level quotas on their S3 storage space. This
feature enhances the flexibility of storage system space management by allowing multiple users or
business entities to use the same storage platform without overconsuming space. Simply specify the
amount of space to be allocated to an account, and then just allow each account to use storage
resources as needed without fear of user overconsumption.</p>

<h3>eXtended Data Management (XDM)</h3>

<p>XDM is a modular configuration that enables RING customers to use advanced cloud features to
  maintain their object stores. Among these are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#metadata">Metadata Search</a></li>
  <li><a href="#transition">Lifecycle Transition</a></li>
  <li><a href="#expiration">Lifecycle Expiration</a></li>
  <li><a href="#crr">Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to the Cloud</a></li>
  <li><a href="#oob">Out-of-Band Updates</a></li>
  </ul>
<p>XDM ingests metadata from RING object stores to maintain an independent RING
  namespace. Using this metadata, it can implement these features with high
  availability and reliability.</p>

<h4 id="metadata">Metadata Search</h4>
  <p>XDM’s Metadata Search feature allows users to employ object metadata to perform
    powerful searches on objects and easily find the data they need, when they
    need it. Metadata search uses the metadata natively created by production
    systems by leveraging Scality's object storage model to inscribe metadata to
    objects and create a searchable, manageable namespace for stored
    objects. The feature relies on a SQL-like syntax to drive a MongoDB search
    and locate important object information like replication statuses, cloud
    replication destinations, metadata headers, tags, and more.</p>

  <h4 id="transition">Lifecycle Transition</h4>
  <p>Lifecycle Transition Policies allows users to control their data movement
    through implemented policies. Users create a transition policy, put it in
    place and wait for the policy to enact. Users can control where their data
    moves, and when it happens&mdash;no manual data transition is needed. Users
    can transition all data within a bucket or transition objects that have been
    specifically tagged. Transition Policies supports data transitions for the
    following clouds: Scality RING, AWS S3, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and
    Ceph.</p>
  <h4 id="expiration">Lifecycle Expiration</h4>
  <p>Object lifecycle expiration policies enable users to delete objects or
    object types based on age.</p>
  <h4 id="crr">Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to the Cloud</h4>
  <p>Cross-Region Replication (CRR) is a bucket-level configuration that enables
    automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in different
    clouds&mdash;whether they are private or public. CRR provides users with
    enhanced data flexibility. It offers greater control over data redundancy by
    replicating to multiple locations; it improves data availability by offering
    multiple copies for high availability, backup, and data migration; and it
    mitigates the costs and lock-in typical of public clouds. CRR is currently
    supported for Scality RING, AWS S3, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and
    Ceph.</p>
    
  <h4 id="oob">Out-of-Band Updates</h4>
  <p>RING 8 with XDM allows ingestion and out-of-band (OOB) updates from S3
    Connector and NFS mount points. Out-of-band updates do not copy object data;
    rather, object data attributes are copied over to XDM for data management
    purposes. Using this information, XDM can act on NFS and S3 Connector mounts
    as it would any other type of bucket, thus enabling Metadata Search,
    Lifecycle Transition, Lifecycle Expiration, and Cross-Region Replication to
    the Cloud.</p>
  <p>Out-of-band updates are available for Scality's RING with S3 Connector or
    for RINGs using the Scale-Out File System (SOFS) targeting NFS-protocol
    mount points. When each location is established, versioning must be
    enabled. Out-of-band updates for S3C offers metrics; for NFS services, the
    metrics feature remains under development.</p>
