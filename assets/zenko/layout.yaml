#
# This file specifies the order components should be added to the generated document.
#
# So where do the file names come from?
# To reference files from within the same product (denoted by asset/<product>) simply use the file name (eg introduction.html)
# To reference files from other projects, or from common, prefix it with the subdirectory name (eg common/issue_header.html)
# To reference generated bits (eg the fixed issues table) use the special prefix $gen/ (eg $gen/fixed_issues)
# Currently there are only 2 generated sections: fixed_issues and known_issues
#
# NOTE: Isolating files by product is not enforced by notomaton, both for flexibility and simplicity. *You* are the only one
#       standing in the way of the turning into a giant pile of spaghetti. WITH GREAT POWER COME GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.
