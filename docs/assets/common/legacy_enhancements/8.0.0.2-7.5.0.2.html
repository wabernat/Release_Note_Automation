<h2>RING 8.0.0.2</h2>

<h3>Ability to Defer the Writes of Parts in an Erasure Coding Write Scenario</h3>

<p>The write operation can be completed as soon as the minimum number of part(s)
specified has been written to the RING. This reduces and possibly nullifies the
impact of some of the slowest partial write operations on the overall
operation.</p>

<h2>S3 Connector 7.5.0.2</h2>

<h3>Account IDs and Keys</h3>
<p>Users can create S3 accounts while being able to set the Account ID, the
Account Access Key, and the Account Secret Key.</p>
